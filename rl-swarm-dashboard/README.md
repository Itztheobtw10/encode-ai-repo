# RL Swarm Dashboard

## Project Overview

The **RL Swarm Dashboard** is a data visualisation tool that enables users to track the performance of a machine learning model trained using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques. The dashboard provides two key visualisations:
1. **Performance Over Time**: A line chart showing the model's progress in terms of reward across multiple episodes.
2. **Swarm Network**: A Force-Directed Graph that visualises interactions between different nodes in a decentralised swarm of RL models. This graph provides insights into how models evolve and collaborate.

The project aims to create a more intuitive way to visualise decentralised machine learning and RL training, specifically focusing on the concept of **swarming models** that train in parallel, enhancing learning efficiency.
